👋 Hello, I'm @Saran-Akshintala!

👀 I'm passionate about optimizing and automating our daily activities using various tools and technologies.

🎥 From 22 Aug 2020 to 25 Jan 2022, I've been a ▶ YouTuber (https://YouTube.com/RishiKushi). My channel aimed to address the challenges faced by parents and students in online education. I have also provided education on digital well-being, parental controls, the latest technologies, tips and tricks, as well as online safety rules and guidelines.

📸 From 2020 to 2022, I've acquired skills in Google Actions, Openshot, GIMP, Adobe Premiere Pro, creating Android TV apps using Tasker and app factory, as well as other life skills such as soldering, TV repair, dishwasher assembly and disassembly, and decorative wall painting.

I have explored Arduino Uno programming, Sonoff IoT Gang3 Switch reset and Tasmota firmware flashing, Davinci Resolve, and Flutter. 
🌱 Currently, From 2024, started exploring Data Science, Machine Learning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence.

💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on any ideas that bring significant value to our daily lives.
