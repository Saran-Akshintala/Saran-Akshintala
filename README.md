👋 Hello, I'm @Saran-Akshintala!

👀 I'm passionate about optimizing and automating our daily activities using various tools and technologies.

🎥 Since August 22, 2020, I've become a ▶ YouTuber (https://YouTube.com/RishiKushi). My channel aims to address the challenges faced by parents and students in online education. I also provide education on digital well-being, parental controls, the latest technologies, tips and tricks, as well as online safety rules and guidelines.

📸 From 2020 to 2022, I've acquired skills in Google Actions, Openshot, GIMP, Adobe Premiere Pro, creating Android TV apps using Tasker and app factory, as well as other life skills such as soldering, TV repair, dishwasher assembly and disassembly, and decorative wall painting.

🌱 Currently, I'm exploring Arduino Uno programming, Sonoff IoT Gang3 Switch reset and Tasmota firmware flashing, Davinci Resolve, and Flutter.

💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on any automated ideas that bring significant value to our daily lives.
